/// encompasses remote execution of a program, whether that be a single binary, a shell, a subsystem,
/// or something else.
///
/// Other major types include X11 channels (not supported by swift-nio-ssh), direct TCP/IP (for
/// forwarding a connection from the SSH client to the SSH server) and forwarded TCP/IP (for forwarding
/// a connection from a socket the server was listening on on behalf the client).

/// Some channel types have associated metadata. That metadata can be retrieved from SSH channels using
/// channel options.
