/// A ``NIOSSHClientUserAuthenticationDelegate`` is an object that can provide a sequence of
/// SSH user authentication methods based on the the acceptable list from the server.
///
/// This protocol defines the interface that will be used by the user authentication state
/// machine to move forward with challenges. Implementers of this protocol are free to take
/// time to actually get responses: for example, for password authentication it is possible
/// that the application would like to provide a user-interactive password prompt. This is
/// enabled by allowing implementers to satisfy a promise, rather than requiring that they
/// synchronously provide a response.

    /// Called when ``NIOSSH`` would like to attempt to offer a new authentication method.
    ///
    /// The callback is provided the authentictation methods that the server is willing to accept in
    /// `availableMethods`. The delegate needs to provide an authentication offer by completing
    /// `nextChallengePromise`. If no further authentication offers are available (perhaps because the server
    /// has rejected them all) then this promise should be failed, which will terminate connection establishment.
    ///

    ///     - availableMethods: The authentication methods the server is willing to accept.
    ///     - nextChallengePromise: An `EventLoopPromise` to be fulfilled with the next authentication offer.
